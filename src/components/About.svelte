    We decided to set up this gofund me to support all the nurses and healthcare professionals who are on the front lines fighting the outbreak of COVID19. Its our friends, family members, neighbors, and even strangers.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    Many of them are going in without the needed supplies, risking their health to help people who need them during his crisis. Being a nurse is hard enough with the demanding hours and long shifts but add this to it its unbelievable what they are doing. Many of them have kids at home, and families to tend to.

    This fund will be used to provide regular breakfest, lunches, dinners, and midnight snacks (we wont forget the night shifts!) to hospital workers. We plan on using as many local businesses as we can to help them as well during this time.
